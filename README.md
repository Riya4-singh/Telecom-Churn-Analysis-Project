# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-Project
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Telco Customer Churn dataset to identify key drivers of customer attrition. The primary objective is to translate raw data into actionable business insights, culminating in a set of recommendations designed to reduce churn .Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy) | PostgreSQL | Power BI | Excel. 

The workflow involved cleaning the raw data using Python (Pandas), storing the prepared data in a PostgreSQL database, and building a dynamic, interactive dashboard in Power BI. The project culminates in a targeted summary report created in Excel for a non-technical audience.

## Key Findings & Recommendations
The analysis pinpointed a significant overall churn rate of 26.5%, primarily driven by two factors:

Contract Type: Customers on flexible month-to-month contracts are far more likely to churn than those on long-term plans.

Internet Service: Subscribers with Fiber optic service show a disproportionately high churn rate, suggesting potential issues with service quality or pricing.

Based on these insights, the key recommendation is to launch a targeted retention campaign for at-risk customers (those on monthly contracts with fiber service), offering incentives to switch to more stable annual plans. This project demonstrates a complete analytical lifecycle, from data wrangling to providing strategic, data-driven business value.
